# Lab4
A game, in which a player (you) should catch balls and regular hexagons, 
but should avoid approaching (not just touching) the creator's (my) car. 
Good music on the background will help you to feel both relaxed and concentrated, 
while the leaderboard will make you play the game more and more and will show, how good you became in this game. 
So, the questions is - will you be able to beat the leaders?
Let's see!
